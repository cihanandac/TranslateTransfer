This program is created with the purpose of transfering additional translations to an existing objects list
file. In the museum where I work, we had a master excel file that we have for transfering the objects informations
to a database, and when we needed to add new translations we realize that it will take a lot of time considering
the number of artefacts. So I wrote this program to ease our burden.
You can use it as it is to use in the same purpose, or you can modify it to help you in a similar work.

Feel free to use and share!
